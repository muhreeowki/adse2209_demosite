            <p> 
                Hi, my name is <big><b>Muriuki Muchiri</b></big>, <i><b>Muh<sub>(mo)</sub></b></i> for short. I was born and raised in <b>Nairobi, Kenya.</b> <br>
                From an early age, I have been a very curious individual. I have always been 
                fascinated with learning how things work. When I was younger I used to take apart all my toy, trying 
                to figure out what made them move on their own. Through this curiosity I developed a love for learning. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I attended a robotics bootcamp when I was about 11 years old. There 
                I discovered programming for the first time, and how it works. I was amazed at how software 
                could make these different hardware components work together, and how I could use them to 
                bring my ideas to life. I began to enjoy solving problems and creating solutions
                using software. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I went on to pick computer science in high school and also participated in two more computing bootcamps. 
                This helped furthered my interest in computing. During this time 
                I built numerous robots individually and together with a team such as a self-navigating 
                robot, and a line-following robot that could make decisions. This developed my leadership 
                abilities as I was the leader of my group and It helped me learn to communicate effectively
                and to listen to other people's opinions.
